				<h1>Installing R/RStudio</h1>
				<p>To use R and RStudio, you need 2 things:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>R</li>
					<li>RStudio</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If for any reason you can't install R/RStudio right now or you would like to use a temporary version to experiment with, you may <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KNortheastern/R-Sandbox/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio" target="_blank">use this R Sandbox.</a> Please note that the sandbox is intended as a temporary solution and may take a while to load, may not always be available, and will not save your work.</p>

				<h2>Install R</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to this 
						<a href="https://repo.miserver.it.umich.edu/cran/">website to download R.</a>

						<p>Note: R is downloaded from websites called "CRAN mirrors." These "mirror" websites are copies of a master website that contains the latest version of R. CRAN stands for "Comprehensive R Archive Network" and refers to the entire group of mirror sites with copies of R. Dividing the distribution of R between these mirror sites helps reduce traffic, improve access speed, and ensure ____. If the CRAN mirror linked above does not work, please <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">choose a new CRAN mirror here</a>.</p>
					</li>

			<h1>Meet R/RStudio.</h1>
			<p>R is a programming language in the same way that JavaScript and Python are programming langauges. RStudio is a tool/software that makes it easier to interact with R by making point-and-click.</p>
			<p>You can use R by itself.</p>
			<p>You cannot use RStudio without R.</p>
			<p>R is very popular and is frequently used for data analysis in a wide variety of fields. It is known for being relatively straightforward to learn and for having an active community that shares custom code back and forth in easy-to-use bundles called "packages."</p>

			<p>Its biggest advantage for data viz is that there is a lot of content online that you can reference for help with your own project. This includes example projects, discussions of common problems and their solutions, and "packages" of functions that you can easily download.</p>

			<p>Its biggest disadvantage for data viz is that the default appearance of most output visualizations is more functional than aesthetic. It often requires extra work to make outputs look beautiful.</p>
